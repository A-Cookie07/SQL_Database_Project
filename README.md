This is a PDF explanation of my final project for Datbase Systems.
We were given a sample comapny interview from a fake phone company, and instructed to listen to our customer,
organize what they needed out of a database, and implement it using mySQL

Section 1: A diagram I made to help organize the Table, as well as visually create the Tables using mySQL Workbench

Section 2: The SQL code to create the above Database Diagram

Section 3: SQL code to insert sample entries into the Database

Section 4: Extracting Key Data from the Database
    4.1: Listing each customer along with their ID, plan type, and the name of their phone plan
    4.2: Listing all phonecalls made
    4.3: Finding the plan type with the Highest Revenue
